## Hi, I&#8217;m Zohair Mansoor {.has-text-align-center}

I am a web developer in Karachi, Pakistan, I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working with some great companies, work side by side to creating new websites and improve the existing websites. My expertise in WordPress, Joomla, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, or Bootstrap in making responsive mobile sites that work well cross-browser to compatibility with all devices for any types of templates. I&#8217;m also designing the logo, app icon, and cover art.

My hobbies reading, explore new things, playing video games, watching movies, and playing the mouth harp. When I am not doing anything else, I watch movies or playing video games.
